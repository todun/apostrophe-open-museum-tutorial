# Custom widget - Layout \(nested\) widgets

- What are layout widgets
- Create a widget with the cli named `columns`
- Add widget to app.js
- What is `skipInitialModal`, and add it
- Reference the baseWidgets helper, using it for the column widgets (right now it should have the rich text widget, with other widgets commented out.)
- Add other column widgets fields, referencing schema docs.
- Fill out the template for two-columns
- Uncomment `columns:{}` in helpers `areas` file since that's now available.
