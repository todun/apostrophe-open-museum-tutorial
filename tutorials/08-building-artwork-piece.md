# Advanced piece - Artwork

- What this piece is and what the fields are going to cover (context for the schema)
- Create new piece with CLI, including page and widget flag (quick note about widget flag)
- Activate the module in app.js.
- Add the schema, leaving the artist join off for now (it doesn't exist yet)
  - Brief note on joins, linking over to guide to schema
  - Note that we're joining to two pre-existing piece types in the start files. A quick note about using pieces for taxonomy ("category-object") and note that locations will be discussed more when building out the related widget.
- Generally what is `construct`? Link to the docs.
- Why are we setting these piece fields like this?
  - The lines for the `artistId` should be commented out until the artists piece is created. Or leave it out altogether.

Should the lorem-ipsum bit be included here? I think it's to help flesh out the demo, so maybe we should leave it out here. Maybe with a warning note explaining the difference with the main repo and why it's there. - AB
