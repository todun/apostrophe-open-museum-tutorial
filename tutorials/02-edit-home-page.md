# Editing the Home page

- Clear contents of main block
- Add `o-wrapper` div and `main` element with classes.
- Add first area to the page, including rich text areas only. No helpers, so include `baseStyles` and `baseToolbar` contents directly.
- Refresh the page and see that you can add stuff.
- Remove comment at the top. (optional)

* No masthead, peer-nav, helpers, etc.
